This is a cloudflare workers project that takes in requests for NFT metadata and images. It protects the metadata of un-minted tokens by only serving JSON files pertaining to minted NFTs. It also gates access to images pertaining to un-minted NFTs.

It is designed to work well with contracts such as the Hashlips Lab ERC 721 NFT contract, as well as any contract that uses the ERC 721 standard. Enjoy!
